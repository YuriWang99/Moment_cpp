You'll want to call it many things. You'll swear it's a sport font in distress. You'll imagine it emblazoned on the flanks of battered starships. You'll wonder what niche, what genre it was ever meant to occupy. Is it a display font? Text? Is that a noise in your ear? A sounding pound against your thoughts? Ask what you think of that sound and it's potential to melt you where you stand, and you'll find this very font staring back on you.
